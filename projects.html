            I am happy to supervise Part II projects which are related to my <a href="/research.html">research interests</a>,
            general software engineering, or my personal interests (games, education, food/cooking, and aviation).
            While I would encourage anyone to come up with their own idea, this page contains some suggestions for projects below.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are interested in one of the projects on this page, a variation of one, or your own, feel free to
            <a href="mailto:michael.gale@cl.cam.ac.uk">send me an email</a>. I would also be more than happy to answer any questions
            about the proposals on this page or to have an informal chat in person.
        </p>
