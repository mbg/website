## Abstract

The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) has been
described in a number of different ways, sometimes resulting
in incorrect implementations. We believe this is due to previous,
imprecise attempts to describe the algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to remove this imprecision through a new
approach inspired by purely functional programming. We use
new specification to implement the deterministic DCA in Haskell
- the hDCA. This functional variant will also serve to introduce
the DCA to a new audience within computer science. We hope
that our functional specification will help improve the quality
of future DCA related research and to help others understand
further its algorithmic properties.
